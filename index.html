                            <p>Hi! My name is Peter McKendrick. My student ID is S3930703 and you can reach me on s3930703@student.rmit.edu.au. I am Māori decent with 2 Brothers and 1 Sister (small family – I know!). Very happily married to Melissa with 2 curious, but cheeky young boys.</p>
                    <p>After completing year 12, I went on to an apprenticeship in the Automotive Industry. Most of the theory has been completed through Queensland TAFE. Working in large workshops/corporations has many great benefits – for me, it was further training to become Master Diagnostic Technician (highest level in auto trade). A few years later, I was allowed to upskill to Dual Trade – Auto Electrician.</p>
                    <p>During my apprenticeship, I used to ride BMX professionally (Street and Halfpipe). In one competition, which was my last, I had a very bad accident. Basically (read further if you dare) my left leg was pointing in a direction it shouldn’t….. yup! I still ride to this day, though just with the family and with NO extreme tricks.</p>
                    <p>I love IoT, Smart things, and Networking. Recently, I have been researching a lot into programming and Raspberry Pi. During my studies in Auto Electrical, we had learned about Gates – How they work and create operations using Gates. My first program was to turn a light bulb on and off, using a series of transistors representing a CPU. I had such a big smile! My new home (in the build process) is full of IoT, with its very own home lab. I am so excited to see it finished</p>
                    <p>Everything starts with an idea on paper. Putting that idea into reality is how I made it to RMIT. Requiring further studies for my career in IT (Idea), I had researched a lot of universities. It was the testimonies on RMIT that caught my eye. Seeing the success of previous students and the excitement of their learning has motivated me.</p>
                    <p>I have no experience in any university studies at all! What I expect from this, is to be challenged and so uncomfortable - I have a very steep learning curve and strive under pressure. It’s not just IT, but everything that university has. Essay’s, Assignments, Team/Group presentations. All my training/study prior has been TAFE or in-class tests. To me, it’s not just IT. It’s also the university.</p>
                            <p>Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.</p>

                    <h3>Overview<h3></h3><h4>The Portable Digital 3D Wheel Alignment.</h4>
                        <p>There are many types of portable wheel alignment analogue/digital readers currently in the market that utilize multiple devices that include a small display screen on each reader. Most of these devices show only a few settings of adjustments and operate one by one. The Portable Digital 3D Wheel Alignment will have each digital reader work in conjunction with each other on a 3D landscape (X, Y and Z axis), whilst utilizing a tablet device to show many fields of views for more superior control. An extra sensor situated on the steering wheel assists with straight-ahead steering adjustments.</p> 
                        <p>Ease to store countless information in i/pads, tablets, and even cloud services regarding multiple makes, models, and procedures. The versatility of the digital readers was originally aimed at racecars on track days, though expansion into local workshops can save owners tens of thousands of dollars in equipment. On-the-go adjustments are very possible right in the owners’driveway with a user-friendly GUI.</p>
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p>The Automotive Industry always looks to innovation, especially when it involves costs, versatility, and availability. Wheel alignments are required in all fields in the Automotive Industry. The average workshop 3D wheel alignment machine can cost up to $10,000. More professional 3D wheel alignment machines can cost in excess of $45,000. Mobile mechanics have to recommend other workshops that defeat the meaning of the Mobile Mechanic.</p>
                        <p>Attaching sensors to wheels will remain the same, the difference will be how the sensors are read. Technology, mainly memory, has increased in capacity and decreased in size. Resulting in a more compact, mobile, and more cost-effective device, compared to its bulkier predecessors. Gyroscope, accelerometers, and compass sensors have also become compact and more affordable.</p>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>There are a few components involved with the Portable Digital 3D Wheel Alignment, and within each Digital Reader, there are several components that make up a working Digital Reader.</p>
                        • Digital Readers. Four (4) units – One (1) per wheel. Incl One (1) rechargeable docking station. Extra digital readers are sold separately.<br/>
                        • Wheel Adapter Bracket. Four (4) units – One (1) per Digital Reader. Extras are sold separately.<br/>
                        • Steering Wheel Digital Reader.<br/>
                        • Steering Wheel Adapter Bracket.<br/>
                        • Steering Wheel Lock<br/>
                        • Stop/Brake Pedal Brace<br/>
                        • Tablet Device – Includes charger, Wi-Fi capabilities, and installed GUI (plug and play).<br/>
                        <p>Each Digital Reader contains a Wi-Fi, Gyroscope, Accelerometer, and Compass sensor which are all programable. Powered by rechargeable batteries over conventional types as the docking station keeps the digital readers charged and in a safe location when not being used. All connected and operating within alloy housing for strength in case dopped or even driven over. On the outside of the alloy casing, you will find a spirit level, two (2) magnetic bases, and a backlit display for initial setup. These Digital Readers will have multiple uses due to the gyroscope/accelerometer. For example, checking angles on frames are true and even square, the speed of objects when attache using the reader’s magnets, plus more</p>
                        <p>Each Digital reader will attach to a Wheel adapter bracket which attaches to the wheel on the vehicle. Strong and sturdy alloy will be required to eliminate flex when in use as this can cause incorrect readings. Steering Wheel Digital Reader will comprise of the same components as the Digital Readers, which attaches to the Steering Wheel Bracket made of the same materials as the wheel brackets. Swivel plates and hoists(etc.) are sold separately as basic sets can be used to complete wheel alignment on most vehicle Steering Lock and Stop/Brake Brace included as required for operational purposes during a wheel alignment. Tablet has a special case to eliminate any damages to the tablet if dropped. High specifications of tablet regarding CPU type, ram, storage, screen resolution, plus more. The tablet will have Wi-Fi to connect to each Digital reader. </p>
                        <p>Custom GUI is user-friendly and intuitive mainly compiled using Python/C++. The tablet can also connect to a local printer source (sold separately) to be able to print results. Updates will be required from time to time and will come from the source home page and be updated monthly. This can be accessed on the tablet if an internet connection is available. Digital Readers will be able to show specific information and compare between each digital reader, creating a 3D database on a supplied tablet.</p>
                    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                        <p>Most of the equipment required is readily available. Sensors like Arduino and Raspberry Pi are great choices when it comes to flexibility in adapting programs, though keeping to a compact design and costs will be the key component in the project. Using tubular steel, mounting brackets, and even spirit levels can complete the physical build of each device. Rechargeable batteries with the device’s very own docking station would be favorable over generic batteries, just to give all devices a more professional feel.</p>
                        <p>The software can be programmed using C++, or Python to create certain parameters regarding specifications on certain makes/models of vehicles. Most of which can be stored on any suitable iPad or tablet for that extra freedom or Mobility. Options to store data (saved work) to a cloud service would be beneficial. This would require the use of Wi-Fi systems</p>
                    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                        <p>Knowledge in using Arduino and Raspberry Pi products is required. Choosing the correct sensors (axis) is important – a single card is more compact, though may not complete all tasks required. Assembly and programming abilities are highly required as most specifications may need to be added manually. Access to data can be sourced and licensed, though this will add to costs.</p>
                        <p>Power tool safety and awareness is required for building housing units for the sensors. Jigs/Rigs can be built to maintain consistency with every device manufactured. An understanding of C++ and Python is highly regarded as creating a program that can be uploaded into each device.</p>
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>There is a demand for more convenient and cost-effective equipment. Wheel alignment machines will always have a presence in most majority of automotive workshops throughout Australia. This product will have a very large impact on the industry. The development of this product has the potential to change the industry, whilst bringing forward more ideas from within the field. Vehicles change, but how repairs are carried out has not.</p>
                        <p>With the original design in workshops being very large and fixed in place, valuable space is taken, the solution to this is compact design along with mobility. Out in the field, there are portable devices used to complete wheel alignment, though these can be clunky and, in some cases, take up reality inside a van/truck. Welcome to the digital age! Lightweight sensors along with an iPad/tablet can save space in vans/trucks along with all the features of a workshop.</p>
